# Athlete_Stats_Query

In this porgram, the user enters the first and last name of an NHL player. The user is then redirected to a Wikipedia
page of the player's career statistics in Mozilla Firefox. The name of the player can be entirely in lower case.

To compile and run the program:
javac Player_Stats.java
java Player_Stats

If you are using Windows and get the error: 'Javac is Not Recognized as an Internal or External Command',
you need to edit your environment variables, edit the 'path' variable, and add the path to the bin of the
java jdk. The path may be something like this: 'C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_144\bin'. Apply this feature
and close the terminal if it was already opened.
